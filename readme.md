# Begin with Stripe

This repository is used as a base for a Stripe API server as part of the final project for WDD01. It is an API built with [Begin](https://begin.com) to get products and start checkout sessions using Stripe

## Endpoints

- `GET products` - Responds with the [List all products](https://stripe.com/docs/api/products/list?lang=node) response from Stripe.
- `GET prices` - Responds with the [List all prices](https://stripe.com/docs/api/prices/list?lang=node) response from Stripe.
- `POST checkout-session` - Responds with a Session ID, obtained from [Create Session](https://stripe.com/docs/api/checkout/sessions/create).

  - Request body:

    ```json
    {
      "quantity": 2,
      "priceId": "price_12345"
    }
    ```
